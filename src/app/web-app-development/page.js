              <>
                A web application is a software program that runs in a web
                browser. It is accessed over the internet and provides
                interactive and dynamic content to users.

              "What are the key technologies used in web application development?",
            answer: (
              <>
                Key technologies include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS
                (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and server-side languages
                like Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and others. Frameworks and
                libraries like React, Angular, and Node.js are also commonly
                used.

              "What is the difference between a website and a web application?",
            answer: (
              <>
                A website typically provides static content for informational
                purposes. A web application, on the other hand, allows users to
                perform tasks, interact with databases, and perform various
                functions.

              "What is the front-end and back-end of a web application?",
            answer: (
              <>
                The front-end refers to the user interface and user experience
                of a web application. It's what the user sees and interacts
                with. The back-end refers to the server, application logic, and
                database that support the front-end.

            question: "What is responsive web design?",
            answer: (
              <>
                Responsive web design is an approach to designing web pages that
                ensures they look good and function well on various devices and
                screen sizes, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

            question: "What is a Content Management System (CMS)?",
            answer: (
              <>
                A CMS is a software platform that allows users to create,
                manage, and update digital content on a website without the need
                for technical expertise. Examples include WordPress, Drupal, and
                Joomla.
